# Release Notes for Ansible AVD 4.x.x

- Documentation for AVD version `4.x.x` [available here](https://www.avd.sh/en/devel/)

## Release 4.0.0

### Changes to requirements

- AVD now requires ansible-core from **2.12.6** to **2.14.x** excluding **2.13.0**
!!! note
    Excluded version **2.13.0** has an issue in `ansible-core`, which is [fixed](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.13.1/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.13.rst#bugfixes) in **2.13.1**. Plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (Fully-Qualified-Collection-Name + short-name).

  If Ansible is installed using pip, a supported version can be installed with `pip3 install "ansible-core>=2.12.6,<2.15.0,!=2.13.0"`.

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 4.x.x](../porting-guides/4.x.x.md)
for details.

#### Change upper case CVP roles and module vars to lower case

Potentially breaking in rare cases where custom logic relies on the registered vars or content of files.
The custom scripts must be updated to use the lowercase variable instead.

Component(s) name
Roles:

- arista.avd.eos_config_deploy_cvp
- arista.avd.cvp_configlet_upload

Modules:

- arista.avd.inventory_to_container
- arista.avd.configlet_build_config

The following vars are changed from uppercase to lowercase, to conform with Ansible linting requirements.

```sh
CVP_CONFIGLETS -> cvp_configlets
CVP_CONFIGLETS_STATUS -> cvp_configlets_status
CVP_CONTAINERS -> cvp_containers
CVP_CONTAINER_RESULTS -> cvp_container_results
CVP_DEVICES -> cvp_devices
CVP_DEVICES_RESULTS -> cvp_devices_results
CVP_FACTS -> cvp_facts
CVP_TOPOLOGY -> cvp_topology
CVP_VARS -> cvp_vars
```

#### IP routing is no longer configured on pure L2 devices

For node types like `l2leaf` where `underlay_router` is set to `false` under `node_type_keys` AVD versions below 4.0.0
still rendered `ip routing` in the configuration. With AVD version 4.0.0 `ip routing` is no longer configured for `l2leaf`
or other node types with `underlay_router: false`.

### eos_designs Network services variables

- `evpn_rd_type` has been removed and replaced with `overlay_rd_type`.
- `evpn_rt_type` has been removed and replaced with `overlay_rt_type`.
